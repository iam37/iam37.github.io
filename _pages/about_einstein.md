Hello! I'm an incoming student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am fascinated by the ways galaxies evolve with their local environments over time, and the role supermassive black holes play in that evolution. I am currently studying post starburst galaxies at high redshift with Drs. Kate Rowlands and Katey Alatalo.

I received by Bachelors of Science degree from Yale University in 2025. As an undergraduate I discovered and studied dual AGN populations in large sky survey fields using machine learning.
